properties:
    owned-channels:
      type: array
      required: true
      description: |
        List of channels in a split-ownership peripheral that are to be owned
        for use by the compiled CPU.

    nonsecure-channels:
      type: array
      description: |
        List of channels in a split-ownership, split-security peripheral that
        are to be configured as nonsecure. In Trustzone systems, this property
        is only evaluated for secure peripherals, as nonsecure channels are
        implicitly specified through the owned-channels property. This property
        is ignored in non-Trustzone systems.

    child-owned-channels:
      type: array
      description: |
        List of channels in a split-ownership peripheral that are officially
        owned by the compiled CPU but intended to be used by its child
        subprocessor(s).
